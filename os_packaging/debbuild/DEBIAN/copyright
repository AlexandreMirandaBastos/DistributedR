Summary     : An environment for executing R functions in a distributed manner.
Description :
R is a single-threaded process.  This limits its utility for big data analytics.  Vertica Distributed-R allows Vertica users to write programs which will be executed in distributed fashion, that is, parts of programs as specified by the developer can be run in multiple, parallel single-threaded R-processes.  The result is dramatically reduced execution times for big data  analytical algorithms.
